I do not like this restaurant,neg
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho,neg
The fries were great too,pos
A great touch,pos
Service was very prompt,pos
Would not go back,neg
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced,neg
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh,neg
potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer,neg
The fries were great too,pos
A great touch,pos
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced      ,neg
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli chicken with cranberry mmmm,pos
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair,neg
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only,neg
Highly recommended,pos
Waitress was a little slow in service,neg
This place is not worth your time let alone Vegas,neg
did not like at all,neg
The Burrittos Blah!,neg
The food amazing,pos
Service is also cute,pos
I could care less...The interior is just beautiful,pos
So they performed,pos
That's right...the red velvet cake....ohhh this stuff is so good,pos
They never brought a salad we asked for,neg
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos and friendly staff,pos
The worst was the salmon sashimi,neg
Also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal,pos
I could not be happier,pos
Overall I like this place a lot,pos
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive,pos
Ample portions and good prices,pos
Poor service the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table,neg
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,pos
Service sucks,neg
The shrimp tender and moist,pos
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again,neg
we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick,neg
On a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service,pos
Frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register,neg
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section,pos
It's too bad the food is so damn generic,neg
The burger is good beef cooked just right,pos
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!,pos
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tastyand the pita and hummus was very refreshing,pos
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside,pos
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table,pos
Their chow mein is so good!,pos
have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food,neg
The portion was huge!,pos
Loved it...friendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu,pos
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant,neg
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom,neg
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked,pos
The ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless,neg
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for posneg minutes,neg
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!,pos
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious,pos
We'd definitely go back here again,pos
We are so glad we found this place,pos
Great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount,pos
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,pos
Update....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,pos
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy,neg
A great way to finish a great,pos
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected,pos
Reallyreally good rice all the time,pos
The service was meh,neg
It took over 3neg min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk,neg
I guess place would suck because it is insideofthe Excalibur but I didn't use my common sense,neg
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well,neg
Very Bad Customer Service !,neg
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well,pos
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good,pos
I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company,neg
both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up,neg
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating,neg
The turkey and roast beef were bland,neg
everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old,neg
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try,pos
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying,neg
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,pos
Omelets are to die for!,pos
Everything was fresh and delicious!,pos
In summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience,neg
like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're flirting with the hottest person at the party,pos
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!,neg
Best breakfast buffet!!!,pos

This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit,pos
Nice spicy and tender,pos
Good prices,pos
Check it out,pos
It was pretty gross!,neg
I've had better atmosphere,neg
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did,neg
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing,neg
don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing,neg
Worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries,neg
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly,pos
you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night,pos
Host staff were for lack of a better word BITCHES!,neg
BlandNot a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing,neg

This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food,neg
Penne vodka excellent!,pos

I had a seriously solid breakfast here,pos
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas,pos

Don't do it!!!!,neg
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us,neg
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service,neg
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me,neg
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food,pos
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated,pos
The menu is always changing food quality is going down & service is extremely slow,neg
The service was a little slow food was coming in a slow pace,neg
I give it 2 thumbs down,neg
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us,neg
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away,pos
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay,pos
We waited for forty five minutes in vain,neg

this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored,pos
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago,pos
this place is good,pos
Unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE,neg
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed,neg
I was seated immediately,pos
Their menu is diverse and reasonably priced,pos
Avoid at all cost!,neg
Restaurant is always full but never a wait,pos
DELICIOUS!!,pos
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area,pos
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...,neg
I've never been treated so bad,neg
Bacon is hella salty,pos
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste,neg
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed,pos
The waitresses are very friendly,pos
Lordy.the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!,pos
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter,pos
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews.but I'm not inspired to go back,neg
The service here leaves a lot to be desired,neg
The atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness,pos
Not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while,pos
We literally sat there for 2neg minutes with no one asking to take our order,neg
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor,neg
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack,neg
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,neg
It was probably dirt,neg
Love this place hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor,pos
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible,pos
The food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined,neg
Interesting decor,pos
What I really like there is the crepe station,pos

Both of the egg rolls were fantastic,pos
When my order arrived one of the gyros was missing,neg

Soggy and not good,neg
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious,pos

The shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!,neg
The service was a bit lacking,neg
Lobster Bisque Bussell Sprouts Risotto Filet ALL needed salt and pepper  and of course there is none at the tables,neg
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in,neg
It was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad,neg
I loved the bacon wrapped dates,pos
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!,pos
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special,pos
As for the "mains " also uninspired,neg
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!,pos
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again,pos
If the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people,neg
Very very fun chef,pos
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah still sucks,neg
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's,pos
If it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it,neg
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce" yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them,neg
I'd say that would be the hardest decision...Honestlyall of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing),pos
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed...Not sure if we will go back and try it again,neg
Everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service,pos
Horrible - don't waste your time and money,neg
Now this dish was quite flavourful,pos
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse,neg
(It wasn't busy either) Also the building was FREEZING cold,neg
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again",neg
-Drinks took close to 3neg minutes to come out at one point,neg
Seriously flavorful delights folks,pos
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas,pos
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood,pos
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back,neg
Owner's are really great people !,pos
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there,neg
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful,pos
Overall I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too,neg
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty,pos
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast,pos
Fantastic service here,pos

I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible,neg
They know how to make them here,pos
very tough and very short on flavor!,neg
I hope this place sticks around,pos
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water,neg
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite,pos
Good servicevery clean and inexpensive to boot!,pos
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion,pos
Plus it's only 8 bucks,pos
The service was not up to par either,neg
Thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time,pos
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!,pos
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe I was wildly disappointed,neg
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!,pos
You cant go wrong with any of the food here,pos
You can't beat that,pos
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman very friendly kind staff,pos
The chefs were friendly and did a good job,pos
I've had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from Jenni Pho,neg
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding,pos
So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter   ,neg
Good case  Excellent value  ,pos
Great for the jawbone   ,pos
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesMAJOR PROBLEMS!!  ,neg
The mic is great    ,pos
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume   ,neg
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts  then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one  ,neg
If you are Razr owneryou must have this!    ,pos
Needless to say  I wasted my money  ,neg
What a waste of money and time! ,neg
And the sound quality is great  ,pos
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery  ,pos
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset   ,neg
Very good quality though    ,pos
The design is very odd  as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all    ,neg
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone ,pos
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED! ,neg
So Far So Good! ,pos
Works great!    ,pos
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last  ,neg
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions  but could not get it to pair again    ,neg
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!   ,pos
The commercials are the most misleading ,neg
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging    ,pos
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery    ,neg
Great Pocket PC / phone combination ,pos
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had ,pos
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me    ,neg
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone    ,neg
Doesn't hold charge ,neg
This is a simple little phone to use  but the breakage is unacceptible  ,neg
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive  ,pos
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed ,neg
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone   ,neg
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juiceHighy recommended ,pos

It has kept up very well    ,pos
Poor Talk Time Performance  ,neg
The case is great and works fine with the 68    ,pos

I was not impressed by this product ,neg
Nice headset priced right   ,pos
I only hear garbage for audio   ,neg
Excellent bluetooth headset ,pos
It has all the features I want  ,pos
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?  ,neg
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS    ,neg
This case seems well made   ,pos
Disappointed with battery   ,neg
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should  ,neg
good protection and does not make phone too bulky   ,pos
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget   ,pos
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it   ,pos
I love this thing!  ,pos
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie ,pos
VERY DISAPPOINTED   ,neg
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 5 seconds and it still works great!    ,pos
I have been very happy with the 5 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end   ,pos
The buttons for on and off are bad  ,neg
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support ,neg
I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice  elegant and cool   ,pos
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously ,pos
Buy a different phone - but not this    ,neg
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly    ,neg
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds    ,neg
A week later after I activated it  it suddenly died ,neg
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes  ,pos
Great for iPODs too ,pos
This device is great in several situations:)    ,pos
Mic Doesn't work    ,neg
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet  I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying   ,neg
Great choice!   ,pos
Nice docking station for home or work   ,pos
This is a beautiful phone   ,pos
Love this product,neg

The battery runs down quickly   ,neg
This item worked great  but it broke after 6 months of use  ,neg

This phone works great  ,pos
The construction of the headsets is poor    ,neg
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper! ,pos
The phone loads super!  ,pos
For a product that costs as much as this one does  I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does    ,neg
Made very sturdy    ,pos
Worked great!   ,pos
The ear buds only play music in one ear ,neg
Dont waste your money   ,neg
Will order from them again! ,pos
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it    ,neg
I found this product to be waaay too big    ,neg
Best I've found so far  I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using ,pos
I'm very disappointed with my decision  ,neg
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone  ,pos
Buyer Beware  you could flush money right down the toilet   ,neg
Definitely a bargain    ,pos
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase   ,pos
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger    ,neg
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures   also has cool styles like black and white  and more    ,pos
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly  which I don't think is the case)  ,neg
I love my 35headset My Jabra35 bluetooth headset is great  the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit    ,pos
The camera  although rated at an impressive  megapixels  renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution  ,neg
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work   ,neg
Sound quality on both end is excellent  I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2  ,pos
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful   ,pos
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case  ,pos
Great product  fast shipping!   ,pos
Absolutely great    ,pos
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad  ,pos
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it   ,neg
It is very comfortable on the ear   ,pos
It has been a winner for us ,pos

I might have gotten a defect  but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone   ,neg

Very Dissapointing Performance  ,neg
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone  ,neg
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand   ,neg

im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it   ,pos
These are fabulous! ,pos
However  BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up   ,neg
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phoneThe price of the cable was excellent    ,pos
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer    ,neg
Performed awful -- muffled  tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call ,neg

They do not last forever  but is not overly expensive to replaceEasy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried   ,pos
I contacted the company and they told me that  although the unit was still under warranty  if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck   ,neg
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!    ,neg
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are ,pos
Great phone ,pos
When I placed my treo into the case  not only was it NOT snug  but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides   ,neg
I'm pleased ,pos
Battery is terrible ,neg
I found the product to be easy to set up and use    ,pos
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear    ,neg
Utter crap Sound quality is TERRIBLE    ,neg
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe  but it did not work  ,neg
No ear loop needed  it's tiny and the sound is great    ,pos
Finally  after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor ,neg
The handsfree part works fine  but then the car tries to download the address book  and the Treo rebootsOverall  I still rate this device high  ,pos
Talk about USELESS customer service ,neg

Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with   ,pos
Setup went very smoothly    ,pos
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it ,neg
A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design ,neg
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off ,neg
It is well made  easy to access the phone and has a handy  detachable belt clip ,pos
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping   ,neg
Can't upload ringtones from a third party   ,neg
Bluetooth does not work  phone locks up  screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked   ,neg
Truly awful ,neg
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone  and a lot better than the worn-out battery did  ,pos
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud)  ,pos
And none of the tones is acceptable ,neg
camera color balance is AWFUL   ,neg
This product is clearly not ready for prime time  I don't care how cool it looks  if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless  ,neg
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!    ,pos
Chinese Forgeries Abound!   ,neg
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell   ,pos
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used    ,neg
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well  ,neg
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!  ,neg
Works well  ,pos
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone    ,neg
Clear crisp sound   ,pos
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided  but it stays on pretty well  ,pos
The biggest complaint I have is  the battery drains superfast   ,neg
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear    ,neg
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster   ,neg
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips ,pos
It doesn't make you look cool   ,neg
Because both ears are occupied  background is not distracting at all    ,pos
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time  if not for an entire day  ,pos
Also  the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s  preferably ripped by Windows Media Player  ,neg
You can't beat the price on these   ,pos
Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots  and even flash SOS signals (seriously!    ,pos
lightweight and works well  ,pos
So just beware  ,neg
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC    ,pos
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation  ,neg
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up ,pos
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since ,neg
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i  ,pos
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM   ,neg
It lasts less than 3o minutes  if I actually try to use the phoneMy wife has the same phone with the same problem   ,neg
Poor quality    ,neg

Not worth it    ,neg
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced  ,neg
Uncomfortable In the Ear  Don't use with LG VX99)   ,neg
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown ,neg
It holds a charge for a long time  is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous   ,pos
I'd like to return it   ,neg
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems    ,pos
Verizon's bills  however  are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple    ,neg
After charging overnight  these batteries work great    ,pos
You won't regret it!    ,pos
I love this phone!  ,pos
A Disappointment    ,neg
Its not user friendly   ,neg
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect ,neg
Then I exchanged for the same phone  even that had the same problem ,neg
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute  ,neg
This PDA rocks  ,pos
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone  and excels in those roles    ,pos
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT25for those who are looking for comfort  clarity and a great price!  ,pos
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service    ,pos
Pretty piece of junk    ,neg
Plug was the wrong size ,neg

The sound quality for the device is unacceptableUnless you are in a really quiet area  you almost hear nothing  ,neg
I would not recommend this item to anyone   ,neg
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad  ,neg
greatno problems at all!    ,pos
As an earlier review noted  plug in this charger and nothing happens    ,neg
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching ,pos
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not   ,neg
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too ,pos
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far ,pos
